      <h2>Can you guess...</h2>
      <p>
        You’re going to be home by 8, listening to the Talking Heads and reading
        Vonnegut or something. That sounds like a nice night. Nancy, seriously,
        you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. It's just, sometimes...

        only hang out with boys. Mornings are for coffee and contemplation. Do
        you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to
        build one?
